Description	Assays	Comment	Source
Indeterminate – low DNA/RNA yield, insufficient tissue	RNA/DNA	The results are indeterminate with low overall sequencing read depth due to a low DNA/RNA yield resulting from insufficient tissue. Therefore, a definitive assessment of the targeted gene regions cannot be performed.	MM - Excelsior
Indeterminate – low DNA yield, insufficient tissue	somatic	The results are indeterminate with low overall sequencing read depth due to a low DNA yield resulting from insufficient tissue. Therefore, a definitive assessment of the targeted gene regions cannot be performed.	MM - Excelsior
Indeterminate – low read depth from decalcification	somatic	The results are indeterminate due to low overall sequencing read depth. Therefore, a definitive assessment of the targeted gene regions cannot be performed. Indeterminate results are likely due to destruction of DNA from decalcification.	MM - Excelsior
RNA portion not performed – DNA-only sample	RNA/DNA	Note: Because only previously extracted DNA was received, the RNA (gene fusion) portion of this assay was not performed. Therefore, the targeted gene fusions described within the methodology cannot be detected in this sample.	MM - Excelsior
RNA portion not performed – DNA-only extraction	RNA/DNA	Note: Only DNA could be extracted from the submitted sample. Therefore, the RNA (gene fusion) portion of this assay was not performed and, the targeted gene fusions described within the methodology cannot be detected in this sample.	MM - Excelsior
DNA portion not performed – RNA-only sample	RNA/DNA	Note: Because only previously extracted RNA was received, the DNA portion of this assay was not performed. Therefore, the mutations and copy number variants described within the methodology cannot be detected in this sample.	MM - Excelsior
Potential false-negative – low/uncertain tumor content	somatic	The percentage of neoplastic cells in the submitted sample is uncertain. This assay may fail to detect molecular alterations present at a level below the limit of detection of this assay due to a low percentage of neoplastic cells.	MM - Excelsior
RNA assay failed – insufficient RNA (consider FISH)	RNA/DNA	The RNA (gene fusion) portion of this assay failed due to lack of extractable RNA within the sample. Therefore, the targeted gene fusions cannot be reliably detected by this assay. Evaluation using FISH studies for ALK, ROS1 and RET is recommended. MM - Excelsior
RNA assay failed – insufficient RNA	RNA/DNA	The RNA (gene fusion) portion of this assay failed due to lack of extractable RNA within the sample. Therefore, the targeted gene fusions cannot be reliably detected by this assay. MM - Excelsior
Potential false-negative – uncertain tumor cellularity	somatic	Note: The neoplastic cellularity (if any) in this sample is uncertain. Therefore, the presence of a variant below the limit of detection of this assay (10% neoplastic cells) cannot be excluded	MM - Excelsior
RNA assay failed after multiple attempts (consider FISH)	RNA/DNA	The RNA (gene fusion) portion of this assay failed after multiple attempts. Therefore, the gene fusions targeted by this assay cannot be reliably detected by this assay. Evaluation using FISH studies for ALK, ROS1 and RET is recommended. MM - Excelsior
Indeterminate – low read depth from very low cellularity	somatic	The results are indeterminate with low overall sequencing read depth, likely due to the extremely low neoplastic cellularity within the submitted cell block. Therefore, a definitive assessment of the targeted gene regions cannot be performed. Testing of a Diff Quik or Papanicolaou stained aspirate smear from this case or other alternative specimen (if available) is recommended.	MM - Excelsior
Depth of coverage	any	A minimal depth of coverage of >250 reads per amplicon or target is strongly recommended for reliable somatic variant detection in clinical NGS panels.	AMP NGS Validation Guidelines
Specimen acceptability	any	Laboratory must reject non-validated specimen types; tumor tissue should be reviewed by a board-certified pathologist for suitability and selection of macro-/microdissection areas prior to testing.	AMP NGS Validation Guidelines
No-template control	any	Include an NTC in every run to verify absence of reagent or carry-over contamination; the control need not be taken through full sequencing.	AMP NGS Validation Guidelines

Variance assessment	any	Test a minimum of three samples spanning all instruments, personnel and reagent lots to quantify variance across the full NGS workflow.	AMP NGS Validation Guidelines
Technical Comments for Molecular Assay Reports
Sanger Sequencing LOD	DNA (Sanger)	Sanger sequencing has a typical limit of detection of ~20% variant allele fraction (approximately 40% mutant allele in a diploid sample).	CAP Molecular Checklist	(2020)
NGS Depth & Sensitivity	DNA (NGS, somatic)	A minimum sequencing depth of >250× per target is recommended for somatic variant detection; lower coverage is acceptable only if justified by the assay’s LOD, read quality, and tolerance for error.	PMID: 28341590
LOD at 95% Detection	DNA/RNA (NGS)	The lower limit of detection (LOD) is defined as the allele fraction at which ≥95% of known positive samples are reliably detected by the assay.	PMID: 28341590
LOD Varies by Variant Type	DNA/RNA (NGS)	The assay’s analytical sensitivity (LOD) differs by variant type; for example, the detection threshold may vary for SNVs, small indels, copy number changes, or gene fusions.	CAP Molecular Checklist	(2017)
LOD Stated in Report	DNA/RNA (LDTs)	The validated lower limit of detection of this test is included in the patient report, in accordance with laboratory-developed test reporting requirements.	CAP Molecular Checklist	(2017)
Reportable Range Disclosure	DNA/RNA (NGS)	The report specifies the test’s reportable range – including which target regions meet coverage criteria, the variant types validated, and the assay’s LOD for each – so that providers know what is not detected.	PMID: 28341590
Reference Range in Report	DNA/RNA (NGS)	A reference range (normal background variation) is included in the report to clarify which types of variants will or will not be reported by this test.	PMID: 28341590
Negative Result Caveat	DNA/RNA (Tumor NGS)	A “no mutation detected” result does not rule out the presence of variants below the assay’s detection limit or in regions not covered; the assay’s LOD and tumor content are considered when interpreting a negative finding.	CAP Molecular Checklist	(2017)
Tumor Purity Requirement	DNA (Tumor NGS)	Adequate tumor cellularity is required for this assay – low tumor purity (e.g., <20% tumor cells) can significantly reduce sensitivity and may lead to false-negative results.	CAP Molecular Checklist	(2017)
Homopolymer Limitation	DNA (NGS – platform)	Due to platform-specific limitations, variants in homopolymer regions (stretches of identical bases) may not be reliably detected; accordingly, a caveat regarding this limitation is noted in the report.	PMID: 28341590
Pseudogene Interference	DNA (NGS)	Regions with high sequence homology (e.g., pseudogenes or segmental duplications) may interfere with analysis – variants in those regions could be misassigned or missed, and results are interpreted with caution.	PMID: 28341590
GC-Rich/Complex Regions	DNA (NGS)	Certain GC‐rich or repetitive regions may have reduced sequencing coverage, which can decrease the assay’s sensitivity for detecting variants in those areas.	PMID: 28341590
Indel Size Limit	DNA (NGS)	The NGS assay is highly sensitive for small insertions/deletions (typically up to ~20 bp); larger indels may not be detected with acceptable sensitivity using standard alignment methods.	PMID: 28341590
CNV Detection Threshold	DNA (NGS – CNV)	Copy number variant detection by this panel is limited to multi-exon alterations; single-exon deletions/duplications or low-level amplifications may not be reliably detected by the assay.	PMID: 28341590
Balanced Rearrangement Limit	DNA (Cytogenomic)	Chromosomal microarray analysis will not detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., balanced translocations or inversions).	PMID: 17389918
Mosaicism & Point Mutation Limit	DNA (Cytogenomic)	Chromosomal microarray cannot detect low-level mosaicism or single-gene mutations – typically a ~20% abnormal cell fraction is required to reliably detect mosaic genomic changes.	Frontiers in Genetics	2023
Mosaic Variant Threshold (Sanger)	DNA (Sanger)	Conventional Sanger sequencing is generally unable to detect mosaic variants present at an allele frequency below ~15–20%.	PMID: 19293843 (Rohlin	2009)
Orthogonal Confirmation	DNA/RNA (NGS)	Any unexpected or complex genomic findings are confirmed by an orthogonal method (e.g., Sanger sequencing, qPCR, or FISH) to ensure result accuracy before reporting.	PMID: 28341590
VUS – Not for Clinical Decision	DNA/RNA (All)	This variant is classified as of uncertain significance and should not be used in clinical decision-making.	PMID: 25741868
VUS Re-evaluation Advice	DNA/RNA (All)	In the event a variant of uncertain significance is reported, healthcare providers are advised to periodically check for updated interpretations, as variant knowledge may evolve over time.	PMID: 25741868
Standard Classification Terms	DNA/RNA (All)	Variants are categorized using the five standard ACMG/AMP terminology tiers – Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, Uncertain Significance, Likely Benign, or Benign.	PMID: 25741868
Unambiguous Nomenclature	DNA/RNA (All)	Each reported variant is described with standardized HGVS nomenclature and a reference sequence (genomic and coding), to ensure unambiguous identification and interpretation.	PMID: 25741868
Tumor-Only vs Germline	DNA (Tumor NGS)	This tumor-only test cannot distinguish somatic from germline variants – patients with pathogenic variants in hereditary cancer genes (e.g., BRCA1/2, ATM) identified on tumor sequencing should undergo confirmatory germline testing.	PMCID: PMC10994438
