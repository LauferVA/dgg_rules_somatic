1	BCR::ABL1	Fusion	"The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors."				transcript_fusion		1	"A,B,C,D"	"Diagnostic,Predictive"	"Positive,Resistance,Sensitivity/Response"	"Dasatinib,Imatinib,Nilotinib,Bafetinib,Dasatinib,Nilotinib,Dasatinib"	"Does Not Support,Supports"

The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors.

306	ERBB2	Amplification	"Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer."	17	37856333	37884915	transcript_amplification		302	"A,B,C,D"	"Predictive,Prognostic"	"Poor Outcome,Resistance,Sensitivity/Response"	"A66,AKTi-1/2,Afatinib,Afatinib,Trastuzumab,Capecitabine,Lapatinib,Cetuximab,Cetuximab,Oxaliplatin,Capecitabine,Cetuximab,Panitumumab,Dacomitinib,Erlotinib,Gefitinib,Irinotecan,Trastuzumab,Lapatinib,Lapatinib,Trastuzumab,MTOR Kinase Inhibitor PP242,Margetuximab,Neratinib,Palbociclib,Trastuzumab,Pertuzumab,Trastuzumab,Pertuzumab,Trastuzumab,Docetaxel,Pictilisib,Tgx 221,Trastuzumab,Trastuzumab Deruxtecan,Trastuzumab Emtansine,Trastuzumab,Afatinib,Lapatinib,Trastuzumab,Capecitabine,Trastuzumab,Lapatinib,Trastuzumab,Neratinib,Trastuzumab,Pertuzumab,Trastuzumab,Pertuzumab,Docetaxel,Trastuzumab,Pilaralisib"	"Does Not Support,Supports"

499	::ALK	Fusion	"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC."				transcript_fusion		495	"A,B,C,E"	"Diagnostic,Predictive"	"Positive,Sensitivity/Response"	"Alectinib,Alectinib,Crizotinib,Brigatinib,Ceritinib,Crizotinib,Entrectinib,Lorlatinib,Pemetrexed,Retaspimycin Hydrochloride"	Supports

Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20). The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90.

Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292."	17	7577062	7579398			1274	B	Prognostic	Poor Outcome		Supports

1739	VHL	R167Q (c.500G>A)	R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.	3	10191507	10191507	missense_variant	"NM_000551.3:c.500G>A,NP_000542.1:p.Arg167Gln,NC_000003.11:g.10191507G>A,ENST00000256474.2:c.500G>A"	1615	C	Predisposing	"Predisposition,Uncertain Significance"		Supports

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

2660	NUP214::ABL1	Fusion	"The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049)."				transcript_fusion		2529	"B,C,D"	"Diagnostic,Predictive,Prognostic"	"Better Outcome,Positive,Sensitivity/Response"	"Dasatinib,Vincristine,Dexamethasone,Imatinib Mesylate,Nilotinib,Dasatinib,Ponatinib,Imatinib"	"Does Not Support,Supports"

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049)."				transcript_fusion		2547	"C,D"	"Diagnostic,Predictive,Prognostic"	"Poor Outcome,Positive,Reduced Sensitivity,Resistance"	"Dasatinib,Imatinib,Imatinib,Dasatinib"	Supports

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein.

2682	FOXP1::ABL1	Fusion	"The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the FOXP1 (Forkhead box P1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion."				transcript_fusion		2551	C	"Oncogenic,Predictive,Prognostic"	"Oncogenicity,Poor Outcome,Sensitivity/Response"	Dasatinib	Supports

The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;12) (p24;p13.1), and has been identified by RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing in three adult patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil and MDN1 domains from ATF7IP and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The coiled coil domain is hypothesized to constitutively activate the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby upregulating the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: The novel ATF7IP-JAK2 fusion has been documented in three cases for which specific clinical information is unavailable. A pre-clinical xenograft model containing the fusion was sensitive to exposure to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib.

The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;12)(p24;p13), cytogenetically cryptic, and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the PNT domain from ETV6 and JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The ETV6 PNT domain is hypothesized to result in dimerization, which leads to aberrant JAK2 kinase domain activation. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functional effects and disease specificity of the abnormal fusion. Functionally, the fusion results in aberrant activation of JAK2 kinase, leading to activation of downstream signaling through the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (~10%), T-lymphoblastic leukemia (isolated cases), and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and gene rearrangements (rare cases). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been associated with high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been shown by limited pre-clinical data and case reports to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors.

The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from BCR and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. In pre-clinical studies, the coiled coil domain of BCR has been shown to mediate oligomeric activation of the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The BCR-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms with eosinophilia (multiple cases), B-lymphoblastic leukemia (multiple cases), acute myeloid leukemia (a rare case), and B-cell lymphoma (rare case of Burkitt lymphoma). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker in B-lymphoblastic leukemia, the BCR-JAK2 fusion is frequently observed in the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion appears to be associated with high-risk disease in pediatric and adult populations. As a predictive marker, patients whose diseases exhibit the BCR-JAK2 fusion have experienced partial responses or even complete remission with hydroxyurea and/or interferon alfa. Case reports have demonstrated the limited utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. OFD1 is a centrosomal protein of primary cilia implicated in Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome type 1, but it has not been previously described in hematologic malignancies. The published breakpoint joins exon 22 of OFD1 to exon 13 of JAK2 (OFD1-JAK2 22-13). This fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(X;9)(p22;p24), and has been identified in two patients by RNA sequencing, one of which demonstrated the abnormal karyotype 46,XY,-17+mar[11]/46,XY[9]. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the FERM and SH2 domains from OFD1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein is reportedly underway. Clinical significance: The novel OFD1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 3-year-old and one 11-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Both children successfully maintained first complete remission following induction chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with as long as 6 years of follow up. While neither patient was treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994)."				transcript_fusion		2843	C	Diagnostic	Positive		Supports

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion."				transcript_fusion		3156	C	"Diagnostic,Oncogenic,Predictive"	"Oncogenicity,Positive,Sensitivity/Response"	"Imatinib,Dasatinib"	Supports

CSF1R is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The breakpoint is not published, but is predicted to be the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;5)(q26.32;q32) and has been identified by RNA sequencing in a single pediatric patient. The consequence of this fusion with respect to treatment response and disease outcome is unknown."				transcript_fusion		3227	C	Diagnostic	Positive		Supports

Characterization of the variant using cell lines expressing EML4-ALK with 1151 T insert found the variant to be highly crizotinib resistant, and other work demonstrated resistance to next generation inhibitor alectinib, while resistance to tool compound TAE684 indicates potential resistance to the next generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib which is derived from TAE684. Other experiments suggest theraputic potential for HSP90 inhibitors, as EML4-ALK T1151 Tins sensitivity to 17-AAG has been observed."	2	29445271	29445272	inframe_insertion	NC_000002.11:g.29445271_29445272insCGT	4307
