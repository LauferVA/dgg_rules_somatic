An interactive and tier-structured HTML report (dashboard-like) that
shows the most relevant findings in the query cancer genome has the
following naming convention:

Interactive HTML report (rmarkdown)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interactive and tier-structured HTML report that shows the most
relevant findings in the query cancer genome has the following naming
convention:

<**sample_id**>.pcgr_acmg.<**genome_assembly**>.html

-  The **sample_id** is provided as input by the user, and reflects a
   unique identifier of the tumor-normal sample pair to be analyzed.

The report is structured in seven main sections, described in more
detail below:

1.  **Report and query settings**

    -  Lists key configurations provided by user

2.  **Main results**

    -  Nine value boxes that highlight the main properties of the tumor
       sample:

       2. Tumor ploidy - as provided by the user
       3. Mutational signatures - two most prevalent signatures (other
          than aging)
       4. Tier 1 variants (top four)
       5. Tier 2 variants (top four)
       6. Tumor mutational burden (TMB)

    -  *Tumor mutational burden (TMB)*

       -  given a coding target region size specified by the user
          (ideally the **callable target size**), an estimate of the
          mutational burden is provided
       -  The estimated TMB is shown in the context of TMB distributions
          from different primary sites in TCGA

    -  *Tier & variant statistics*

          types and tiers

          filtering along several dimensions (call confidence, variant
          sequencing depth/support, variant consequence etc.)

    -  *Tier tables*

       -  Variants are organized into five (tier 1-4 + noncoding)
          interactive datatables) according to clinical utility
       -  Contents of the tier tables are outlined below

4.  **Somatic CNAs**

    -  *Segments - amplifications and homozygous deletions*

       -  Based on user-defined/default log-ratio thresholds of
          gains/losses, the whole CNA dataset can be navigated further
          through filters:
       -  cytoband
       -  type of CNA event - *focal* (less than 25% of chromosome arm
          affected) or *broad*
       -  log ratio

    -  *Proto-oncogenes subject to copy number amplifications*

A compressed JSON file that stores all the essential content of the
report is provided.

This file will easen the process of extracting particular parts of the

Variant call format - VCF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A VCF file containing annotated, somatic calls (single nucleotide
variants and insertion/deletions) is generated with the following naming
convention:

Here, the **sample_id** is provided as input by the user, and reflects a
unique identifier of the tumor-normal sample pair to be analyzed.
Following common standards, the annotated VCF file is compressed with
`bgzip <http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html>`__ and indexed with
`tabix <http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html>`__. Below follows a
