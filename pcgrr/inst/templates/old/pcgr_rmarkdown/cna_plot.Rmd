The top panel of the figure displays __log_r__ with chromosomes alternating in blue and gray. The green line indicates the median log_r in the sample. The purple line indicates the log_r of the diploid state. The second panel displays __logOR__. Segment means are plotted in red lines. The third panel plots the total (black, __cnTotal__) and minor (red, __cnMinor__) copy number for each segment. The bottom bar shows the associated cellular fraction (__cf__), revealing clonal and subclonal copy number events. Dark blue indicates high cellular fraction, light blue indicates low cellular fraction. Beige indicates a normal segment (total=2,minor=1).
