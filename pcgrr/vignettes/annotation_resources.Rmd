### Basic variant consequence annotation
  * [VEP](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) - Variant Effect Predictor release 112 ([GENCODE v46](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/) as gene reference database (v19 for grch37))

###  *Insilico* predictions of effect of coding variants
  * [dBNSFP](https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP) - database of non-synonymous functional predictions (v4.5, November 2023)

###  Variant frequency databases
  * [gnomAD](http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) - germline variant frequencies exome-wide (r2.1, October 2018)
  * [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) - database of short genetic variants (build 154)
  * [Cancer Hotspots](http://cancerhotspots.org) - a resource for statistically significant mutations in cancer (v2, 2017)
  * [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) - somatic mutations discovered across 33 tumor type cohorts (release 39.0, December 2023)
 
### Variant databases of clinical utility
  * [ClinVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) - database of clinically related variants (June 2024)
  * [CIViC](https://civicdb.org) - clinical interpretations of variants in cancer (June 21st 2024)
  * [CGI](http://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org/biomarkers) - Cancer Genome Interpreter Cancer Biomarkers Database (CGI) (October 18th 2022)

### Protein domains/functional features
  * [UniProt/SwissProt KnowledgeBase](http://www.uniprot.org) - resource on protein sequence and functional information (2024_03)
  * [Pfam](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/#table) - database of protein families and domains (v35.0, November 2021)

### Knowledge resources on gene and protein targets
  * [CancerMine](https://zenodo.org/records/7689627) - Literature-mined database of tumor suppressor genes/proto-oncogenes (v50, March 2023)
  * [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) - Database on disease-target associations, molecularly targeted drugs and tractability aggregated from multiple sources (literature, pathways, mutations) (2024.06)

### Notes on variant annotation datasets

#### Data quality

__Genomic biomarkers__

Genomic biomarkers included in PCGR are limited to the following:

* Evidence items for specific markers in CIViC must be *accepted* (*submitted* evidence items are not considered)
* Markers reported at the gene level (e.g. __BRAF mutation__, __BRCA1 oncogenic mutation__)
* Markers reported at the variant level (e.g. __BRAF p.V600E__)
* Markers reported at the codon level (e.g. __KRAS p.G12__)
* Markers reported at the exon/gene level (e.g. __KIT exon 11 mutation__, __BRCA1/2 oncogenic mutations__)
* Within the [Cancer bioMarkers database (CGI)](https://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org/biomarkers), only markers collected from FDA/NCCN guidelines, scientific literature, and clinical trials are included (markers collected from conference abstracts etc. are not included)
* Copy number gains/losses
